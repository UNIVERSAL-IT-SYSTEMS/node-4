Attention
=================================================

The files in this folder are collected from the STM32 Peripherial Library 3.5.0 (STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0.zip downloaded from ST.com). 

However, these files are provided by ARM.com. 

Generally, you needn't modify these files because they're work with Cortex-M3 CPU rather than the STM32 microcontroller.
